# Excel-VBA-Tools
Some tools I use daily for working with excel books

# Quick_Format
Quick_Format is an excel tool for quickly finding out the format of an excel cell. To use it, select the cell you would like to check and run the macro, a window will apear with the format of the cell. This is super useful for custom formats or locked cells where it makes it just a bit easier to see what the format of the selected cell is.

# Quick_Cell_Copy
Quick_Cell_Copy is an excel tool for quickly getting the selected cell refence(s). To use it, select the cell(s) you would like to record and run the macro, your clipboard will then contain a copy the cells refence. This is super useful for writing documentation for excel worksheets where you need to write select cell refences.
